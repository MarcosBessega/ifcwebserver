#summary IfcWebViewer

== Introduction ==

IfcWebViewer is a part of IfcWebServer Project, however it is still in a beta verion.

===How it work?===
IfcWebServer converts the geometry representation of ifc objects into the  open and standard 3D format "COLLADA". The render takes place in the browser with help of a WebGL script library (http://spidergl.org/).

so you need to use a WebGL enabled browser to be able to use IfcWebViewer  (Google Chrome/Firefox), MS Internet Explorer is NOT supportd.

===Since there are enough free IFC viewers available why we need to reinvent the wheel again ?===
We are not trying to create a professional ifc web viewer in any case.Viewing big models online will be always a bottle neck for the performance. but we are trying to create a simple viewer to support the idea behind IfcWebServer (getting information about the building model easily) with features like :
 * show the results of filters/queries directly in the browser for a partial model filters (select/hide operation)
 * change the color of objects according to their properties for example for validation rules.

IfcWebServer is a web-application, so adding the web browser makes sense as well.

At moment the following ifc geometry classes are supported through native Ruby code extensions:
{{{
IFCLINE
IFCPOLYLINE
IFCCOMPOSITECURVE
IFCTRIMMEDCURVE
IFCRECTANGLEPROFILEDEF
IFCCIRCLEPROFILEDEF
IFCARBITRARYCLOSEDPROFILEDEF
IFCFACEBASEDSURFACEMODEL
IFCFACE
IFCFACETEDBREP
IFCCONNECTEDFACESET
IFCCLOSEDSHELL
IFCFACEOUTERBOUND
IFCBOUNDINGBOX
IFCSHELLBASEDSURFACEMODEL
IFCEXTRUDEDAREASOLID
IFCGRID
}}}

Any contribution are welcomed to support more classes.

if you need only to view your ifc models using IfcWebViewer without the need to use special features you can convert any ifc model using free tools in easy steps :
 # Open your ifc file with [http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/soft/4926512/ DDS-CAD 7.3] and export it in 3ds format
 # import the 3ds into [www.blender.org Blender] and export it again in COLLADA (dae extension)
 # Upload your file to the IfcWebServer or to any server around the world.
 # copy the url of your file to the URL input box 
 # Enjoy
