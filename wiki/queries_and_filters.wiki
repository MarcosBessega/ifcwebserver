The main objective of using IfcWebServer is to simplify the process of extracting building information from IFC files as standard format for BIM.

==1. selection queries on the level of classes ==
to get a list of all object instances of a certain IFC class:
 # select the IFC file from the drop-down list
 # scroll through the left list box until you find the class and click on it
 # select the output format of the query result (html, xml, ifc,etc.)
 # press 'go' button or hit return key

you can repeat step 2 to add more classes for your selection query

===Note===
----
when you select an abstract class (e.g. IfcBuildingElement) you will get a
list of all of it's sub-classes object instances (IfcColumn, IfcSlab, IfcBeam, etc.)
